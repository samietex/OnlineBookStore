### Constraints

* **Primary Keys:**
  * Each table has a primary key (e.g., Book ISBN, Author ID, Customer ID, etc.).
* **Foreign Keys:**
  * Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys (e.g., Customer ID in Orders references Customers).
* **Unique Constraints:**
  * Ensure uniqueness of attributes (e.g., unique ISBN for each book).
* **Not Null Constraints:**
  * Essential attributes cannot be null (e.g., book title, author name).
* **Check Constraints:**
  * Validate data (e.g., rating must be between 1 and 5).

### Sample Data
